# Artist Database

I go to a lot of concerts, and was having trouble keeping track of who I have and have not yet seen.

I need a solution that allows me to select all the artists I have seen at a given venue, year, etc. Excel and Excel macros are an OK solution, but  SQLite is better for performing queries. SQL is also more relevant to my future interests. 

This was also a good opportunity to learn how to program a GUI in Python. 

For now, just one table is created which has columns for Artist, Date, Venue.

## Dependencies

* You will need [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/download.html) on your machine
* The tabulate python module: `pip install tabulate`
* A program to view the db file will be helpful. [sqliteonline](https://sqliteonline.com/) or [SQLiteStudio](https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/releases)
