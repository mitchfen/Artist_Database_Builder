# Artist Database

Python program using SQLite to build table of artists I've seen.
For now one table is created which has colums for Artist, Date, Venue.

## Dependencies

* You'll need sqlite3 on your machine
* `pip install tabulate`
* A program to view the db file will be helpful. [sqliteonline](https://sqliteonline.com/) works fine.
